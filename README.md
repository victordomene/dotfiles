# vimrc

This is a *very* simple .vimrc setup. This will definitely be updated in the
future. It's more of a reference for me.

As of now, it uses [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) in order
to install some useful plugins. I was using Pathogen before, but meh, Vundle
wins.

After installing Vundle, don't forget to :PluginInstall (rather than Bundle).

Includes the following plugins:
* [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim)
* [syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic)
* [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)
* [fugitive.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
* [surround.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)
* [nerdcommenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter)

It also uses the [jellybeans](https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim)
color scheme.
