# dotfiles 

This is a very, very simple dotfiles setup that does the minimum work for a
usable environment.

It includes the configuration for the following components:

* vim
* tmux
* editorconfig
* dotbot (to install it all)
* jellybeans colorscheme

## Installation

Dotbot, so just run `install` and you're good to go.
